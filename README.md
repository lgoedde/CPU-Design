# CPU-Design

Sorry for a bit of mess. You can see the development process throughout the semester by taking a look at each branch. Master branch corresponds to a working singlecycle processor. From there on out, each lab or step is a branch and the working code is in it's corresponding branch. Ignore the caches and pipeline branches, because those are just the default when pulling from the course account. Happy 437ing!
